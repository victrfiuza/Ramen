 ラーメン 
I am working on a website for a Japanese 🍜 ramen 🍜restaurant using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will have several pages, including a home page, a menu page, a story page, and a contact page. The home page will have a banner image with a call-to-action button to order online, as well as information about the restaurant and its history. The contact page will have a form for customers to send inquiries or feedback. The website will also be optimized for mobile devices, with a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
